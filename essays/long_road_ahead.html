  <h2 id="the-past">The Past</h2>
<p>Prior to college, I had zero experience with programming. Sure, I thought the Roomba vacuuming my floor was cool but I never thought about the things that went on behind the scenes that allowed it to do what it’s supposed to do. Eventually, it was time to pick a major so I thought, “Engineering is pretty cool” and decided to study computer engineering just like that. Fortunately for me, it was definitely the right decision and I enjoyed it a lot. My first experience with programming was in EE160 which teaches the very basics of programming in Python. A year later, I took EE260: Introduction to Digital Design which introduced us to the hardware side of computer engineering. I personally, was not the biggest fan of hardware topics and decided to focus mostly on software whenever I could.</p>

<h2 id="the-present">The Present</h2>
<p>The road was quite rough getting to this point but I like to think that I have become quite proficient in my programming skills. In EE205 we had jumped the difficulty 5x compared to EE160, introducing many intricate design strategies, skills, and a massive semester-long project. I also know a lot more about DSA’s and the pain of trying to analyze time complexities thanks to EE362 and EE367. Heck, I even know some very basics of machine learning. However, there is still one thing I don’t know that I am itching to learn about and that is web development. Luckily for me, I am finally taking ICS 314 where I can learn all about it and hopefully create something of value by the end of the course.</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>
<p>I only have one year left before I get that certificate that I would have worked 4 long years for. So the ‘Future’ is actually getting quite close. As for what I want to do, I’m actually not sure yet. I will most likely end up doing what interests me at the time which is probably some SWE job. In the even nearer future (next few months), I want to be able to expand my web development skillset which will probably consist of being proficient in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as well as various other things I haven’t learned about yet. After seeing all the things you can do with web development from my peers, I am excited to learn from this course and develop the skills needed to step out into the industry.</p>
