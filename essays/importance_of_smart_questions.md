## What is a Smart Question?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communication is one of the essential skills a software engineer needs to develop. Furthermore, asking 'smart' questions can be considered one of the most important communication skills from a professional perspective. But what is considered a smart question anyway? 
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, a smart question can be seen as one that is well-thought-out, informed, and designed to elicit meaningful information. In the context of software engineering where the majority of questions are asked on online forums like StackOverflow, the previously mentioned characteristics still remain true but there are also new aspects we must consider. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First off, having a descriptive and meaningful title can increase your chances of your post getting clicked on and viewed in the first place. In the meat of the post, the problem should be descriptive and should also be followed with the goal you had in mind. For programming/code questions, this can be done by posting your broken code and describing in detail what it is supposed to do. Asking questions in this way not only increases your chances of getting them answered but can also help other people who run into the same issue down the line. 

## A Smart Question
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout the millions of posts on StackOverflow, here is one example of a user who asked a smart question in the post titled, ["JavaScript property access: dot notation vs. brackets?"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4968406/javascript-property-access-dot-notation-vs-brackets)
```
Q: Other than the obvious fact that the first form could use a variable and not just a string literal,is there any reason
to use one over the other, and if so under which cases?

In code:

// Given:
var foo = {'bar': 'baz'};

// Then
var x = foo['bar'];

// vs. 
var x = foo.bar;

Context: I've written a code generator which produces these expressions and I'm wondering which is preferable.
```
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this example, the user's title is quite straightforward and is able to convey the question without needing any extra context as it is asking for the difference between using two different property access methods as well as the language it is referring to (JavaScript). In the body of the post, the user provides us with a very basic code example to help the us readers understand with more detail what they question is trying to convey. Additionally, this post has amassed nearly 200k vieews meaning many others have had this question too, myself included. 

## A Not-So-Smart Question
It would be amazing if all the questions were smart. Unfortunately, that is not the case as we have this post titled, "
