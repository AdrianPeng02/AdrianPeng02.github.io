This semester I have taken my first software engineering course. Prior to this, all my coursework revolved around circuitry, hardware, and algorithms just to name a few. Basically, I had no experience creating an actual product or knowing the process behind it. Now that I have completed ICS 314, I can confidently say that this was one of the most enjoyable courses I have taken throughout my college career because of all the relevant and applicable concepts and tools we have learned. Generally speaking, I would say everything I have learned this semester from ICS 314 is equally important but I would like to highlight the concepts of Development Environments as well as Coding Standards as I believe they are more important for future coursework as well as the professional field.
