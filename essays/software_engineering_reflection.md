## Introduction
AI in education can be a touchy subject because it is often grouped with things like cheating and academic misconduct. However, I think that AI can be an extremely helpful tool in education as it can help students understand concepts in different ways. The field of software engineering is where there are a lot of small details and intricacies that are hard to memorize or even get taught. Using a language model such as ChatGPT or a pair programming AI like Co-Pilot can really help the user learn if used in that way. Personally, I have used ChatGPT and Co-Pilot quite a few times to answer any questions I may have or fix small bugs in where I don't notice where the error may be. Overall, it saves a lot of time in debugging and trying to figure out how things work.
