## My First Experience

Prior to taking this course, I had essentially zero experience with JavaScript. The most I knew about the language was probably the name and that it was used for web development. So when we were tasked to complete some JavaScript lessons on CodeAcademy, I was quite excited. Excited because learning JavaScript will allow me to broaden my skill set and introduce me to new fields. That same excitement was quickly washed away with fear. Signing onto FreeCodeCamp and seeing over a hundred lessons that are due in a couple of days made me reconsider my excitement. However, as I started doing the lessons, my fear slowly faded as they turned out to be quite simple thanks to my prior experiences with C, C++, and Python from my previous coursework. I managed to complete the entire introduction and ES6 courses in only a couple hours and I think it was a great introduction to all the things you can do with the language. However, I don't think I am competent enough yet to develop complete projects using what limited knowledge and experience I have. Hopefully, as this course proceeds, I will be able to hone and develop my skills to become a JavaScript master. 

## Another Language In The Books
Learning JavaScript is like learning any other language. As mentioned previously, I have learned C, C++, and Python from my engineering courses so learning JavaScript was a process I am familiar with. Doing the JavaScript course, I noticed a lot of symtax similarities to C and C++. More specifically, for-loops, while-loops, if-else statements, and functions are written in a very similar fashion. I also noticed some pretty big differences in the languages. The most significant for me was variable declaration. In C and C++, you need to declare the variable type as an 'int', 'char', 'bool', etc. However, in JavaScript you can declare any variable with the 'var' or 'let' and it will just work like magic. 


## The foolproof way to get ignored.

While there are decent questions that benefit everyone, there are those one can ask to create an entirely different effect. In the following example, a user asks how he would, in short, create a desktop application with Facebook.

```
Q: Facebook Desktop Notifier

I am a beginner programmer that have never used anything other than what's included in a language.

I am trying to create a desktop application that notifies me anytime I get an update onfacebook. 
How should go about doing this? Thanks in advance.

edit Sorry I was not clear. Is there any way to make a DESKTOP application with facebook?
```

A simple “yes” would have answered the question, but we know that’s not the sort of answer he or she is looking for. Fortunately, someone kindly responded with a link to Facebook’s developer website. The asker should have done more research on his or her potential project. Then further down the road, he or she could have asked more specific and detailed questions that wouldn’t require a thousand-paged response for a sufficient answer.

## Conclusion

When we rely on others’ generosity and expertise to provide answers to our questions, it should hold that the question we ask should be one that leads to efficient and effective help that not only benefits us, but also the people we ask and others who might ask the same question in the future. Thus, if you have a question… make it a smart one! Asking questions may not always get you the best answer, but asking them in a way that will make others want to answer them will increase the success of finding a good solution and make it a positive experience on all sides.
